# MediVault Authentication Fix

## Changes Made

1. Created a centralized API utility with Axios interceptors to automatically:
   - Add authentication tokens to every request
   - Handle 401 unauthorized errors by redirecting to login
   - Simplify API calls throughout the application

2. Implemented proper authentication state management with React Context:
   - Created AuthContext for managing authentication state
   - Implemented token validation on app startup
   - Improved protected routes behavior

3. Updated middleware on the server to properly handle token expiration

4. Fixed navigation and routing:
   - Protected Home route and redirected to Dashboard for authenticated users
   - Updated Layout component to show different navigation based on auth state
   - Fixed issue with logout not being properly applied across all pages

## How to Restart the Application

To apply these changes, please follow these steps:

### Server Restart:
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

### Client Restart:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing Authentication Flow

1. Visit the login page and authenticate
2. Navigate to Dashboard and other pages - you should remain logged in
3. Try clicking links like Home/Features - you should be redirected to Dashboard
4. Try logging out - you should be fully logged out across the app

The authentication issue should now be resolved. Users will stay logged in when navigating between pages, and any API token issues will be properly handled.
